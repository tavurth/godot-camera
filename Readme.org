#+TITLE: Godot Camera

After looking for (and failing to find) a basic camera implementation for Godot I decided to build out this simple example library.

When launched the app opens the camera selector (CameraSelect.tscn), and after the user clicks on a chosen camera a new scene is displayed with the users camera input rendered to a viewport.

When the user clicks "Capture" the `photo_taken` signal is emitted including the image at that moment from the camera.

** Signals

*** CameraSelect.tscn
- camera_selected(camera: CameraFeed) is emitted when the user clicks on any camera

*** Camera.tscn
- photo_taken(ViewportTexture) is emitted when the user clicks on `capture` in the camera view
